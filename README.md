# Comp150-MOB-Tiny-Project

## Overview
This is my tiny project assignment for the course MOB. This program is for me to get used to android-studio environment. This app only contains 2 activity and a couple of simple viewsï¼Œand it's actually meaningless.

## How to use
This is the source code generated by **Android Studio**. You can import the whole project into Android Studio and export the _.apk_ file. After that, you can copy the file to your Android phone and install.

## Requirement
This app is built for Android phones with Android 6.0 or higher version.
