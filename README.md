# Comp150-MOB-Tiny-Project

## Overview
This is my tiny project assignment for the course MOB. This program is for me to get used to android-studio environment. This app only contains 2 activity and a couple of simple viewsï¼Œand it's actually meaningless.

## How to use
This is the source code generated by **Android Studio**. You can import the whole project into Android Studio and export the _.apk_ file. After that, you can copy the file to your Android phone and install.

## Requirement
This app is built for Android phones with Android 6.0 or higher version.

## What I learned from this project

1.  I learned how to set up Android Studio and how to run an Android Virtual Machine to debug.
2.  We can use a layout to make widgets align horizontally or vertically.
3.  We need to set all 4 constrains to ensure layouts not going out of the screen.
